## Hi there 👋 I am Angga

I am currently working as a Solutions Architect at AWS.

Prior to AWS, I worked in several companies such as Philip Morris International, Pahamify, Tunaiku and Halodoc as a data engineer. 

I am currently exploring and learning about emerging tech stacks in data engineering such as dbt, great expectations, nosql, and trying to getting hands-on with Java, Javascript, machine learning and its statistical concept.
